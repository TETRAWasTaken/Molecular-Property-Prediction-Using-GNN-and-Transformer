## Dataset EDA

### QM7 ( Anshumaan )
* Contains a X feature with **Coulomb Matrix** of each Molecule [ 7165 x 23 x 23 ]
* Contains a Z feature with **Charge** of each Atom in Molecule [ 7165 x 23 x 1 ]
* Contains a R feature with **Cartesian Coordinates** of each Atom in Molecule [ 7165 x 23 x 3 ]
* Contains a T feature with **Atomisation Energy** of each Molecule [ 7165 x 1 ]
* Contains a P subset which hold the validation set for the dataset.
